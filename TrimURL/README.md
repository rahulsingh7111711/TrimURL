# URL Shortener

A lightweight URL Shortener built as part of a hands-on system design learning journey.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Takes a long URL and returns a shortened version.
- Resolves a short URL back to the original long URL.
- Stores URL mappings in memory (for now).
- Designed to be extended into a scalable, production-grade system.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git 

### Run It

```bash

# Run the script
python shortener.py
